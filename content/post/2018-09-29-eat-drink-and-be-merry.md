The [Friends of Ryebank Fields](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofRyebank) celebrated the August Bank Holiday weekend by bringing together around 150 people for a community picnic. 

The sun shone on residents of all ages, and some extremely handsome dogs, as they met friends old and new and enjoyed the wild green space. Labour councillors Eve Holt and John Hacking came along to listen to the views of residents and show support for a meaningful engagement. We gathered lots of signatures for our [petition](https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/give-ryebank-fields-back-to-the-people) and even raised some money for the printing of our fabulous posters.

Head to the Friends of Ryebank Fields [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofRyebank) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ryebankfields) to stay up to date with how this much loved green space is used by the local community and wildlife.
