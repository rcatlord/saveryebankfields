The Friends of Ryebank Fields’ have produced a [leaflet](https://www.saveryebankfields.org/post/2020-10-02-response-to-mmu-site-investigations_files/site_investigations_leaflet.pdf) in response to Manchester Metropolitan University’s site investigation reports. We will be delivering copies of the leaflet to the surrounding area in both Chorlton and Firswood. The contaminated and unstable state of the land should be a material consideration at the planning stage. Please share this information far and wide and if you can help deliver leaflets please let us know.
