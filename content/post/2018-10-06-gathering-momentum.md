As the nights draw in and the memory of summer fades, the Friends of Ryebank Fields campaign is enjoying an unseasonable flowering.

Local magazine [Trafford Community News](http://online.anyflip.com/uzcm/owfq/mobile/index.html) has covered our concerns and the success of [our community picnic](https://www.saveryebankfields.org/post/eat-drink-and-be-merry/) event on 2 September.

We were heartened to be featured alongside fellow local green campaign the [Breathe Clean Air Group](https://en-gb.facebook.com/BCAGtrafford/). They are welcoming the news that Peel Energy are now unlikely to build their proposed biomass heat and power plant in nearby Davyhulme. Their campaign offers hope to us and others battling to preserve green and healthy environments in our cities.

Our online presence continues to grow with over 400 members of the Friends of Ryebank Fields [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofRyebank) group, approaching 200 followers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ryebankfields), 640 signatures for our [petition](https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/give-ryebank-fields-back-to-the-people) as well as many paper signatories.

Windows around Chorlton, Stratford and Firswood are starting to fill up with our striking posters. If your home is showing support why not post a picture on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofRyebank) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ryebankfields) to get the message out even further.

If you are a member of the group who thinks they'd like to become more involved or indeed are new to the campaign please don't hesitate to get in touch. We are particularly keen to hear from people with knowledge of wildlife and environmental issues or legal planning processes. Watch this space for an upcoming fundraising event on Saturday 3 November at the Chorlton Irish Club.
