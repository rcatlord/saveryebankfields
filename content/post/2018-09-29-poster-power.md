The Friends of Ryebank Fields are grateful to Mark Pivaro for designing these fabulous posters for their campaign. The posters build on the identity and success of the neighbouring campaign to [Save Turn Moss](https://friendsofturnmoss.tumblr.com). We are sure that residents of Chorlton, Firswood and across south Manchester will once again clear a space in their windows to show the world how much we value our green spaces.
