All are welcome to join our community walks, every Sunday at 12.30pm, on Ryebank Fields. Come along to meet new friends and find out more about this special place. Weâ€™ll be looking at its unique features including the Nico Ditch, Aspen Grove and Millennium Oaks; listening to bird song and taking time to breathe. You can use our Community Walks leaflet - download <a href="/post/2020-01-12-community-walks_files/community_walks_leaflet.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> - for a self-led walk on Sundays or at any other time.

Look out for guest speakers (advertised on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofRyebank" target="_blank">Facebook group</a>) including foragers, poets, history and nature lovers, and local people with tales to tell. If you would like to get involved in contributing to a walk please get in touch. 

Please bring the whole family; dogs are welcome. Dress for the weather; wellies are often required and please take care as some paths are muddy and uneven.
