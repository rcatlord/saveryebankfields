If you’re planning a healthier more sustainable way of living in 2021, why not try our online [Ryebank Recipes](2021-01-02-ryebank-recipes_files/ryebank_recipes.pdf) book for some ideas? The recipes are inspired by plants and flowers that can be found growing wild on Ryebank Fields. Foraging is a family friendly way to try new things whilst getting outdoors and learning more about our natural environment. The book was created over the course of a year and follows the seasons in terms of what plants are available to pick. If you enjoy using it please consider making a <a href="https://gf.me/u/yx223k" target="_blank">donation to our campaign</a>.

<strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: Manchester Metropolitan University’s Human Health Risk Assessment states that the land is not currently suitable for allotment end use. We know that local residents have been foraging on Ryebank Fields for years, however, we cannot categorically state that it is safe to continue to do so. We are still sharing our recipes as our future vision for Ryebank Fields supports creating and promoting a sustainable food source and the use of wild foods and simple hedgerow ingredients is an integral part of this. You should be able to find all the plants we have featured either growing wild locally or in parks or gardens.
