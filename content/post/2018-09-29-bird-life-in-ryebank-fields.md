Local ornithologist [Pete Hines](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPu_qWesoYJ-lmXYucPo2QQ) has been delighting and educating Friends of Ryebank Fields with his photos and sightings of birds on our cherished wild space. 

Many locals have been amazed at the diversity of bird species who call the fields home. Sparrowhawks, chiff-chaffs, rooks, meadow pipits, and house martins have all be spotted, reminding us that the fields are already inhabited even without the proposed housing development.

Pete's sightings are all logged [here](https://ebird.org/hotspot/L6860096) on [ebird.org](https://ebird.org/home), a citizen science project run by Cornell University that captures data on species numbers and whereabouts and opens this up to the international birding community.

Keep an eye on the Friends of Ryebank Fields [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofRyebank) for updates from Pete and others of bird sightings, particularly as the seasons change.
