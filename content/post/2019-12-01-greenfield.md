Ryebank Fields are **GREENFIELD**. The <a href="https://mappinggm.org.uk/gmodin" target="_blank">Greater Manchester Open Data Infrastructure Map</a> (GMODIN) produced by the <a href="https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Greater Manchester Combined Authority</a> (GMCA), the 10 councils that make up Greater Manchester, clearly shows that the land is classed as greenfield. Plus Ryebank Fields is NOT included in the <a href="https://secure.manchester.gov.uk/info/200074/planning/7293/brownfield_land_register" target="_blank">Brownfield register for Greater Manchester</a>. 

<a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-planning-policy-framework/4-decision-making" target="_blank">Paragraph 38</a> of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2" target="_blank">National Planning Policy Framework</a> states:     

> local planning authorities should use the full range of planning tools available, including brownfield registers...    

The <a href="https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/media/1710/gm_plan_for_homes_jobs_and_the_environment_1101-web.pdf" target="_blank">Greater Manchester Spatial Framework</a> (GMSF) refers throughout to “a brownfield-first approach to the release of sites for development” as quoted from <a href="https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/the-mayor" target="_blank">Mayor Andy Burnham's</a> introduction.

And <a href="https://democracy.manchester.gov.uk/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=153" target="_blank">Sir Richard Leese</a> states in his <a href="https://www.manchester.gov.uk/blog/leadersblog/post/887/how-green-is-my-city" target="_blank">blog</a> (2019-10-14):    

> Our zero carbon city still needs more homes and more jobs and the most sustainable way of providing for those is through dense development on brownfield sites close to public transport nodes. The alternative is concreting over greenfield sites for what would be very car dependant development. 

<a href="https://www.manchester.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Manchester City Council</a> (MCC) has <a href="https://www.climateemergency.uk/blog/manchester/" target="_blank">declared a Climate Emergency</a> and Ryebank Fields is a much needed green lung for the city. It is an integral resource for the health and well-being of our community. 

Why then has MCC adopted a <a href="https://www.manchester.gov.uk/downloads/download/7074/ryebank_road_development_framework_2019" target="_blank">Development Framework</a> for a **GREENFIELD** site? 

Why too are <a href="https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Manchester Metropolitan University</a>, who pride themselves on their <a href="https://peopleandplanet.org/university/129459/ul19" target="_blank">green credentials</a>, attempting to profit from the <a href="https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/ryebank-fields/" target="_blank">destruction</a> of a **GREENFIELD** site?
