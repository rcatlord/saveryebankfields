Manchester Metropolitan Universityâ€™s final development framework for Ryebank Fields which was approved by Manchester City Council in July 2019 can be viewed <a href="https://www.manchester.gov.uk/downloads/download/7074/ryebank_road_development_framework_2019" target="_blank">here</a>. The framework is now part of the planning process and any future development proposals will have to be measured against these guidelines alongside other considerations.

This document updates the draft development framework which was <a href="https://secure.manchester.gov.uk/info/200024/consultations_and_surveys/7576/consultation_on_new_housing_and_redevelopment_in_chorlton/2" target="_blank">consulted</a> on in 2017. The principle difference between the two frameworks is a proposal to build 120 rather than 70 new homes.
