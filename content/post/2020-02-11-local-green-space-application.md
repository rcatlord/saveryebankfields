Please help the Save Ryebank Fields campaign by responding to Manchester City Council's consultation on the 'Manchester Local Plan' and encourage everyone you know to do so aswell. This could be our best chance to save Ryebank Fields. You don’t have to live in the Manchester borough to do this.   

We need as many people as possible to respond to <a href="https://secure.manchester.gov.uk/info/200074/planning/6572/local_plan/2" target="_blank">the Council’s consultation</a> before the deadline of 5pm on Friday 3 April 2020, but please do it **NOW**.   

The Council has the power to designate Ryebank Fields as a "Local Green Space" in the Local Plan. If Ryebank Fields was designated as a Local Green Space it would make it very hard for anyone to develop on it in future so it is worth lobbying hard for this as part of the consultation response.   

If you are short of time a simple email to the planning department stating that you wish to respond to the consultation and want the council to designate Ryebank Fields as a Local Green Space is something that would take no more than a few minutes.  

The email address is: <a href="mailto:planningstrategy@manchester.gov.uk">planningstrategy@manchester.gov.uk</a>

However, what would be even better would be to write a longer email setting out the reasons you want Ryebank Fields to be protected as a Local Green Space with particular reference to the criteria which can be found in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2" target="_blank">National Planning Policy Framework</a>.

This should not take too long - we have set out a draft email that you might want to use as a starting point:     

…

Dear Sir/Madam

I wish to respond to the consultation on the draft Local Plan for Manchester. I would ask the Council to designate the area known as Ryebank Fields in Chorlton as a Local Green Space.

Please then give your reasons why you feel the land should be designated as a Local Green Space. Please reference the criteria for Local Green Space designation which is set out in paragraph 100 of the National Planning Policy Framework:    

**1.** The land needs to be "in reasonably close proximity to the community it serves""

This probably speaks for itself – you may wish to point out you live close by and use it frequently.

**2.** The land needs to be "demonstrably special to a local community""

Please explain why you feel the land is demonstrably special to the local community e.g.

- **Beauty**: Please explain why you think the site is beautiful for example you may wish to comment on the wild nature of the site, the wild flowers, the number of trees wildlife etc and how it links with the park .

- **Historic significance**: You may wish to comment on the <a href="https://www.saveryebankfields.org/post/hands-offa-ditch" target="_blank">Nico Ditch</a> and historic use of the land by the community

- **Recreational value**: You may wish to comment on the number of recreational activities e.g. walking, community walks, blackberry picking, bird watching, the community orchard, carols at Christmas etc and how this affects your own well being

- **Tranquillity**: You may wish to draw attention to the tranquillity of the site and how this differs from e.g. the meadows which are close to the motorway or that the site offers an oasis of calm in the middle of a large bustling city or that it is a truly unique area due to its wild nature

- **Richness of wildlife**: Please comment on any wildlife you are aware of in the area.

**3.** The land needs to be "local in character and is not an extensive tract of land"

Again this probably speaks for itself clearly as the Ryebank Fields is self-contained with boundaries on all sides.

Kind regards

…
