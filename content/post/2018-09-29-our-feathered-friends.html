<p>Local ornithologist <a href="https://twitter.com/Hines1Peter">Pete Hines</a> has been delighting and educating <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofRyebank">Friends of Ryebank Fields</a> with his photos and sightings of birds on our cherished wild space.</p>
<p>Many locals have been amazed at the diversity of bird species who call the fields home. Sparrowhawks, chiff-chaffs, rooks, meadow pipits, and house martins have all be spotted, reminding us that the fields are already inhabited even without the proposed housing development.</p>

<p>Peteâ€™s findings are all logged <a href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S48753621">here</a> on <a href="https://ebird.org/home">ebird.org</a>, a citizen science project run by Cornell University that catures data on species numbers and whereabouts and opens this up to the international birding community.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the Friends of Ryebank Fields <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/FriendsofRyebank">facebook page</a> for updates from Pete and others of bird sightings, particularly as the seasons change.</p>
