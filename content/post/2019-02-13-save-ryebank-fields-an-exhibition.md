You are invited to attend ‘Save Ryebank Fields - An Exhibition’. The launch event will be on Monday 4th March from 6pm, and the exhibition runs until 8th March.

The exhibition is organised and curated by MMU art student, Josie Tothill, to celebrate Ryebank Fields and protest about the privatisation and destruction of this much loved green space. 

The launch event will be an opportunity to meet campaign organisers and find out why it is so important to preserve Ryebank Fields for future generations. There will be free tea made from plants growing in the fields (please bring your own mug), talks, entertainment and, of course, art.

There is also a free yoga class on Wednesday 6th March at 12pm, focussing on slow flow practise and exploring how we can connect to nature. 

The exhibition will take place at [MMU Link Gallery, Faculty of Art & Design, Chatham Building, Cavendish Street, Manchester, M15 6BR](https://goo.gl/maps/VguWhJ88pDD2).

We hope to see you there.
