Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) have now stated that they will commence marketing Ryebank Fields sometime in Autumn/Winter 2020 and their preferred developer will then submit a planning application at some point. 

We would like to share the following document, <a href="https://github.com/rcatlord/saveryebankfields/raw/master/static/docs/ashton_2020" target="_blank">"A Working Research Report on Ryebank Fields: Its uses and impacts"</a>. It has been written by <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/jenna.ashton.html" target="_blank">Dr. Jenna C. Ashton</a> of Manchester University in association with the Friends of Ryebank Fields and was presented to the MMU board in March this year as an alternative to the sale of the land for housing. It was rejected along with proposals from their own students (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/mmu.peopleandplanet" target="_blank">MMU People and Planet</a>) and Ryebank Residents Association. 

The report is based on surveys carried out by over 60 users of Ryebank fields, analysed by Dr Ashton and considers the findings in light of existing research evidence of the <a href="https://www.micra.manchester.ac.uk/research/projects-and-groups/ghia/" target="_blank">GHIA project</a> (Green Infrastructure and the Health and Wellbeing Influences on an Ageing Population) undertaken by The University of Manchester, The University of Salford and Manchester Metropolitan University. It puts forward our vision to continue to use the land as a community resource and how this can and should be achieved. We have been privileged to work with Dr Ashton and we are very grateful to have her on board with our campaign. 

Please read and share the report. We intend to add personal stories with photographs of members of the community who have used the fields over the years. If you wish to contribute to this, please email the group at <a href="mailto:ryebankfieldsfriends@gmail.com">ryebankfieldsfriends@gmail.com</a> and in the subject put ‘Memories of Ryebank Fields’. If a planning application is submitted, this report will be the main part of our objection submission. We are also working to produce guidance on how individuals can object to a planning application and this will follow. There is still so much work being done to try and prevent an application being submitted. If you wish to volunteer and have any particular expertise in this area or time to offer then please get in touch.
