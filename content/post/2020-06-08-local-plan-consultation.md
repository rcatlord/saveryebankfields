Thank you to everyone who responded to Manchester City Council’s Local Plan Consultation.

We have written confirmation that over 30% of all responses received requested that Ryebank Fields be designated as a Local Green Space or otherwise preserved from development. 

The council are currently sending out acknowledgement emails to respondents. If you sent a response either by email, letter or online submission and you don’t receive an acknowledgment please contact the council at <a href="mailto:planningstrategy@manchester.gov.uk">planningstrategy@manchester.gov.uk</a> to query this. Please read your acknowledgment email carefully. If you didn’t originally provide your full name and address, please do so now as this will ensure you remain informed and involved as the Local Plan is progressed.

Further information on the Local Plan review can be found <a href="https://secure.manchester.gov.uk/info/200074/planning/6572/local_plan/2" target="_blank">here</a>.
