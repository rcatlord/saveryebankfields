Thank you to everyone who came along to our inaugural AGM on Wednesday 23rd October 2019. It was a really well attended meeting where we formally adopted our <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/1MwldKw1ou4gnkkpGo16zzqgIb1kYmEPq/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msword" target="_blank">constitution</a> and elected our committee. We are very pleased to say that we are now a legally constituted group and as such will be seeking to be involved at every stage of consultations with Manchester Metropolitan University, in relation to their ongoing development proposals for <a href="https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/ryebank-fields" target="_blank">Ryebank Fields</a>, which we will, of course, continue to oppose.

In accordance with the ‘Aims’ set out in our constitution, we intend to put forward an alternative vision for the fields which will benefit both the local community and be a valuable educational resource for MMU students.
